            <h1>Our Story</h1>
            <p>Accuracy Accounting & Financial was founded in 1993 by Alexandria Lozano in a 1,200 sqft strip mall rental space. Alexandria was just 24, right out of Arizona State University, at the time. She hired 4 of her college friends to work at her small accounting firm. A year later her accounting firm was serving over 200 local families and  was beginning to catch the attention of local small businesses. In 1995 Accuracy landed a huge client, Arizona Public Service. Accuracy put a huge financial plan in place that saved Arizonans thousands of dollars in electricity bills and boosted APS's revenue by over 20%. By 2005 Accuracy was the largest Accounting and Financial firm in the state of Arizona with clients like Costco and Dairy Queen. In 2008, Alexandria stepped down as CEO, and was replaced by Maureen McRae the former CFO. By 2010, Accuracy was serving over 100 Fortune 500 companies. In 2019 Accuracy Accounting & Financial is the second largest Accounting and Financial firm in the nation. </p>

        My favorite part of the whole experience was being able to make a phone call to my accounting firm and having a real live person pick up the phone. I was never once put on hold, or transferred. The accountants are so knowledgeable and friendly. They treat me like a real person and that's not something many big companies can boast.

        As a startup educational firm we weren't really finance experts. I needed a team backing me that knew what they were doing. When I hired Accuracy I had a great feeling about them and as I began to work with them that feeling only got better. Accuracy has been there every step of the way helping us build our dream into a reality.
